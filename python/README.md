# My LLM Project

... (项目描述) ...

## Code Style and Linting

This project enforces a consistent code style using `black`, `isort`, and `flake8`, managed by `pre-commit`.

### Tools Used:

*   **`black`**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style across the project.
*   **`isort`**: Sorts and groups Python imports to improve readability.
*   **`flake8`**: A linter that checks for stylistic errors and potential bugs.

### Setup Instructions:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_awesome_project.git
    cd my_awesome_project
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate it (Linux/macOS):
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Activate it (Windows CMD):
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install development dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # (Optional: if you have a dev requirements file)
    # Or directly install the tools if not managed by requirements-dev.txt
    # pip install black flake8 isort pre-commit
    ```
    *(Note: If you use `pyproject.toml` for project metadata, `pip install .[dev]` might be used if you have specified dev dependencies there.)*

4.  **Install `pre-commit` hooks:**
    After cloning, the `pre-commit` hooks need to be installed into your local Git repository:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```
    This command sets up a hook that automatically runs `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` before each commit.

### How it Works:

Whenever you run `git commit`, `pre-commit` will automatically:
*   Run `black` to format your Python code.
*   Run `isort` to sort your import statements.
*   Run `flake8` to check for style violations and potential errors.

If any of these tools modify your code or report issues, the commit will be **aborted**. You will need to fix the reported issues and re-stage your changes, then run `git commit` again.
